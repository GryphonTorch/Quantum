Quantum cognition research done at Yale since August 2020

We are interested in modeling human cognition using quantum physics-based models, 
which may be amenable to quantum computers. A first step is developing near-term
quantum algorithms, namely the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, to compute the 
eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix (which can later be tailored to cognitive
science models). Preliminary results for getting the first few lowest states are
linked in this repository. 

Language used is Python Qiskit, compatible with IBM quantum computers.
